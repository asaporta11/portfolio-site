				<h3>Challenge</h3>
				<p>I designed and developed Pulseband: a data visualization tool that empowers users with cardiac risk factors to prioritize which lifestyle changes would be most impactful in lowering their risk for a cardiac event.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>This was an exploratory project in which my task was to identify where to focus the Pulseband product (branding was not part of this project). For example, the Pulseband name was already specified as was the fact that it was a wearable device. Therefore, I was given the freedom to make decisions about the functionality of the product. Though this project was assigned to everyone in my cohort, I sought a dual focus on UX and development so I worked alone in a sprint environment.</p>

				<h3>Evaluate</h3>
				<h4>Research</h4>
				<p>In order to design a useful and effective tool, I sought to understand more about the field of Cardiology and the specific challenges of patients, doctors, and caregivers. Consequently, I conducted a literature review and interviewed health professionals, caregivers, and patients. 
				</p>

				<h6>User Interviews</h6>
				<p><span>WHO</span> cardiac patients, cardiologists, caregivers</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'><span>WHAT</span> semi-structured interviews tailored to each population</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'><span>GOAL</span>  identify pain points with patient access to resources and implementation of new strategies to incite habit change</p>
				<div class= 'placeholder'><img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class="placeholder-img"></div>
				<p class='caption-text'>Placeholder text</p>

				<h6>Synthesis</h6>
				<p>Interviews taught me that understanding one’s own complex matrix of nutrition, physical activity, and preexisting conditions left patients feeling overwhelmed. Patients were unsure about which risk factors to address first, leaving them paralyzed with how to proceed. For example, if patients had high blood pressure due, in part, to high cholesterol and blood sugar, they were unsure about where to start: blood sugars or cholesterol? They also struggled with recognizing small improvements in the early stages of habit change.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'><span>This combination of paralysis and difficulty in recognizing small improvements lead to failure to implement and sustain new strategies.</span> My goal in creating the pulseband product was to address this problem.</p>
			</section>

			<section id='product-design' class='product-design proj-text'>
				<h3>Product Design</h3>
				<p>Since user research revealed that users, i.e. patients, are often discouraged by an overwhelming amount of information <!-- sense of paralysis --> and experience difficulty recognizing that small changes can have a large impact in the long term, I began the product design process with the goal to address these barriers to change. </p>

				<h4>Design Principles</h4>
				<p>I created a set of design principles that guided my problem solving process so that I could build a tool that would effectively empower patients to begin and sustain habit change.</p>
				<h6>Educate</h6>
				<p>users so they come away with a better understanding than they had before: help them understand that many different factors contribute to heart health, yet help them avoid getting lost in the details.</p>
				<h6>Motivate</h6>
				<p>users by helping them notice small changes and encourage them to stick with positive modifications.</p>
				<h6>Balance</h6>
				<p>users’ self-knowledge with their doctor’s recommendations; encourage exploration with Pulseband yet emphasize that their doctor is best for synthesizing all their information.</p>
				<h5>Synthesis</h5>
				<p>The process of defining these principles helped me prioritize the most important issues Pulseband had to address and understand how to approach each problem. Consequently, this helped me focus and refine my solutions during the ideation process.</p>

				<h4>Ideate</h4>
				<p>Guided by the design principles established above, I entered the ideation phase with the objective to ensure the tool I created would be valuable to users.</p>

				<h5>Educate: data visualization</h5>
				<p>User research revealed that patients have a difficult time understanding how heart health involves a complex interdependence of factors (cholesterol, sugars, weight loss, blood pressure, etc) so I needed to find a user-friendly way to represent them. Establishing the educate design principle helped me recognize that data visualizations can effectively demonstrate how multiple factors interact. This, in turn, could be modeled as an educational experience as long as the graph was designed in a user-friendly way.</p>
				<img src="img/pulseband-data-vis-section1.jpg" alt="" class='vert-image'>
				<p class='caption-text'>I started with a line graph concept that indicated which factors correlated together, but this made the data seem daunting.</p>
				<!-- <h6>Cognition and Data Visualization</h6> -->
				<p>Since graphs can be overwhelming, <span>I turned to cognitive psychology to understand how to best represent data in a user-friendly way</span>. To make effective visualizations, I needed to understand how the brain processes visual information from the perspective of attention, memory, and understanding scale. Therefore, I conducted a literature review to better understand what makes for optimal learning conditions in a data visualization environment.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg' class='key-takeaways' ><span>We have <a href="http://steveharoz.com/research/isotype/ISOTYPE_Visualization_CHI2015_Haroz_Kosara_Franconeri.pdf">limits</a> on our attention and working memory.</span> Therefore, superfluous images distract from interpretation, so the graph must be simple.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'><span>Instant Feedback </span>is critical to the learning process. Motion and color changes serve as forms of feedback. For example, colors can indicate healthy or unhealthy ranges and graphical movement prompted by user interaction amplifies user engagement.</p>
				<img src="img/pulseband-cog-psych-section1.jpg" alt="" class='vert-image'>
				<p class='caption-text'>Users are presented with a graph of their current data. Since the graph is interactive, dragging a bar simulates the user’s potential future state of health.</p>
				<h6>Synthesis</h6>
				<p>Understanding the cognitive factors that influence our ability to interpret and learn from graphs directed my focus to which visual attributes of the Pulseband product were most important to promote user engagement.</p>

				<h5>Motivate: Small changes affect the big picture</h5>
				<p>Using the motivate design principle as a guide, my goal was to find a way to help users take ownership of their health while encouraging positive, sustainable change. Forging this connection should be easily accessible and intuitive to users, so I turned to simulation as a potential answer to this problem. <!-- creating a simulation environment fulfilled the need to connect a user’s current health state with a potential future state. --> <!-- , implementable, and actionable --></p> 
				<p class='subs-pg'><span>Simulation connects a current state of health with a potential future state</span>. This helps users envision what their future health situation might look like if they make certain health changes in their current state.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>How can users gauge their overall cardiac health in an informative and accurate metric? <!-- to address the big picture of users’ overall heart health? -->From my literature review, I found that the <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/HeartAttackToolsResources/Heart-Attack-Risk-Assessment_UCM_303944_Article.jsp#.V0Yx6pMrJDU" target='_blank'>American Heart Association</a> assesses patients’ susceptibility to a cardiac event in the form of the % risk metric. Because this summarizes the varied and complex factors that affect heart health into a single output, I incorporated it so that users could come away from the experience with a succinct message about their overall health state.</p>
				<img src="img/pulseband-motivate-annotated1.jpg" alt="" class='vert-image'>
				<p class='caption-text'><img src="img/annotate-dot.png" alt="" class='annotate-dot'>The % Risk bar helps users understand how small changes in daily habits affect their overall susceptibility to a cardiac event.</p>

				<h5>Balance: Connect to medical professionals</h5>
				<p>Help users understand that Pulseband can help them start a discussion about health goals with their doctor. An important feature of the Pulseband is that it has data on the age, height and weight of the user and the wearable nature of the product enables it to take measurements of factors related to heart health. Since this assignment gave us license to create fictitious features, this extends to cholesterol and blood sugar measures, though this technology isn’t on the market yet.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>The graph will come pre-populated with users’ data for each metric (blood pressure, heart rate, physical activity, cholesterol, blood sugars, and BMI). This way, <span>users can simulate a future health state based off their current state and work with their doctor to understand how to make the changes that will lead to the simulated state</span>.</p>
				<img src="img/pulseband-balance1.jpg" alt="" class='vert-image'>
				<p class='caption-text'>This is an initial sketch of Pulseband functionality that broadly emphasizes when users should confer with their doctors.</p>

				<h5>Summary</h5>
				<p>The ideation process challenged me to recognize when I found good solutions and, likewise, when I didn't think my answers were viable. This balance of holding space for uncertainty while recognizing when something wasn't working helped me move to the prototyping phase with a new sense of clarity.</p>

				<h4>Rapid Prototyping &amp; Usability Testing</h4>
				<p>Knowing that the prototyping process needed to incorporate interactivity to overcome the pain points that come with making data visualizations accessible and informative, I learned that some of the most informative prototypes could be low-fidelity. With a short timeline and development looming, paper prototyping was the most effective way to identify solutions.</p>
				<img src="img/pulseband-prototype1-annotated.jpg" alt="" class='vert-image'>
				<p class='caption-text'><img src="img/annotate-dot.png" alt="" class='annotate-dot'>This prototype made it possible for me to identify pain points in interactivity. For example, users struggled with understanding the healthy range sections for each metric.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>In the above prototype, users were confused about the healthy range sections. Knowing that this wasn't intuitive enough for the user, I recognized that an interactive component of the graph needed to include the bars changing colors based on whether the value was low, healthy, above average, or dangerous.</p>
				<img src="img/pulseband-prototype2-annotated.jpg" alt="" class='horiz-image'>
				<p class='caption-text'><img src="img/annotate-dot.png" alt="" class='annotate-dot'>In this prototype, bar colors change based on the value the bar represents (low, healthy, above average, high). For example, the cholesterol bar is red because its value is high whereas activity is low so its bar is blue.</p>
				<h5>Summary</h5>
				<p>Prototyping taught me how to listen to users closely and their feedback helped make Pulseband innately understandable. Knowing the reasoning behind design decisions made the development process easier and this experience continues to remind me that designers and developers should be in close communication.</p>

				<h3>Product Development</h3>
				<p>Being my own dev was difficult because with every exciting new idea, there was a major problem solving challenge. I was caught between the excitement of a more intuitive solution and the complexity of the coding test that this new idea presented. I had minimal programming experience going into the DESIGNATION program, so I worked tirelessly at learning the D3.js and jQuery libraries to implement my designs.</p>
				<h4>Final Product</h4>

				</div>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>This was my first foray in wearable tech so learning about user needs to access their data - and how to integrate it with their lives - was valuable, yet I discovered the specific challenges that result when representing data with accuracy and clarity. Combined with the health tech space, and consequently the added importance of representing this data correctly, I understood the significance of being true to the user at the expsense of giving them data without the tools to understand it. </p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>The experience of doing UX and development helped me understand how dev-UX relationships should operate: <!-- ownership and respect are key, -->collaboration is a key component of problem solving and all roadblocks should be treated as opportunities for teammates to help one another. I practice applying these principles in all projects I work on, including <a href="index.html#projects">subsequent projects</a> at DESIGNATION and beyond.</p>
