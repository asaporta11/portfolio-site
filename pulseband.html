				<h3>Challenge</h3>
				<p>I designed and developed a data visualization tool empowering users to prioritize which lifestyle changes would be most impactful in lowering their risk for a cardiac event.
				</p>
				<p>This was an exploratory project where I was given the freedom to make decisions about the functionality of the product. Though this project was assigned to everyone in my cohort, I sought a dual focus on UX and development so I worked alone in a sprint environment.

				<h3>Evaluate</h3>

				<p>This was an exploratory project where I was given the freedom to make decisions about the functionality of the product. Though this project was assigned to everyone in my cohort, I sought a dual focus on UX and development so I worked alone in a sprint environment.
				</p>
				<h4>Research</h4>
				<p>In order to design a useful and effective tool, I needed to learn more about the field of Cardiology and the specific challenges of patients, doctors, and caregivers. Consequently, I conducted a literature review on cardiac care patients and interviewed health professionals, caregivers, and patients. 
				</p>
				<h6>User Interviews</h6>
				<p><span>Who</span> cardiac patients, cardiologists, caregivers</br>
				<span>What</span> semi-structured interviews tailored to each population</br>
				<span>Goal</span> identify pain points with patient access to resources and implementation of new strategies to change habits</p>
				<div class= 'placeholder'><img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class="placeholder-img"></div>
				<p class='caption-text'>Placeholder text</p>
				<h6>Synthesis</h6>
				<p>From conducting interviews, I learned that understanding one’s own complex matrix of nutrition, physical activity, and preexisting conditions left patients feeling overwhelmed. Patients were <span>unsure about which risk factors to address first</span>, leaving them paralyzed with how to proceed. For example, if patients had high blood pressure due, in part, to high cholesterol and blood sugar, they were unsure about where to start: blood sugars or cholesterol? They also <span>struggled with recognizing small improvements</span> in the early stages of habit change.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'><span>This combination of paralysis and difficulty in recognizing small improvements lead to failure to implement and sustain new strategies.</span> My goal in creating the pulseband product was to address this problem.</p>
			</section>
			<section id='product-design' class='product-design'>
				<h3>Product Design</h3>
				<p>Since user research revealed that users, in this case patients, are often discouraged by a sense of paralysis and experience difficulty with recognizing how small changes can have a large effect in the long run, I began the product design process with the goal to address these barriers to change. </p>
				<h4>Design Principles</h4>
				<p>I created a set of design principles that would guide my problem solving process so that I could build a tool that would effectively empower patients to begin and sustain habit change. These principles helped me focus and refine my solutions during the ideation process.</p>
				<h6>Educate</h6>
				<p>users so that they come away with a better understanding than they had before: help them understand that many different factors contribute to heart health, yet help them avoid getting lost in the details.</p>
				<h6>Motivate</h6>
				<p>users notice small changes and encourage them to stick with their positive changes; likewise, help them right lapses in positive modifications.</p>
				<h6>Balance</h6>
				<p>users’ self-knowledge with their doctor’s recommendations; encourage exploration with this tool yet emphasize that their doctor is best for synthesizing all their information.</p>
				<h4>Ideate</h4>
				<p>Guided by the design principles established above, I entered the ideation phase with the objective to ensure the tool I created would be valuable to users.</p>
				<h5>Educate: Data Visualization</h5>
				<p>User research revealed that patients have a difficult time understanding how heart health involves a complex interdependence of factors (cholesterol, sugars, weight loss, blood pressure, etc) so I needed to find a user-friendly way to represent them. Establishing the educate design principle helped me recognize that data visualizations can be an effective way of showing the ways in which multiple factors interact. This, in turn, could be modeled as an educational experience as long as the graph is accurate and not intimidating.</p>
				<img src="img/pulseband-data-vis-section.jpg" alt="" class='image'>
				<p class='caption-text'>I started with a line graph concept that indicated which factors correlated together, but this made the data seem daunting.</p>
				<h6>Cognition and Data Visualization</h6>
				<p>Since graphs can be overwhelming, I turned to cognitive psychology to understand how to best represent data in a user-friendly way. To make effective visualizations, I needed to understand how the brain processes visual information from the perspective of attention, memory, and understanding scale. Therefore, I conducted a literature review to better understand what makes for optimal learning conditions in a data visualization environment.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg' class='key-takeaways' ><span>We have limits on our attention and working memory.</span> Therefore, superfluous images distract from interpretation, so the graph must be simple.</p>
				<div class='dv-key-takeaways' class='subs-pg'>
					<p class='subs-pg'><span>Simulation: </span>connects a current state with a potential future state. This could help users envision what their future health situation might look like if they make certain health changes based on their current state.</p>
					<p class='subs-pg'><span>Instant Feedback: </span>critical to the learning process. Use motion and color changes as forms of feedback. For example, colors could indicate healthy or unhealthy, graphical movement upon user interaction would amplify user engagement.</p>
				</div>
				<img src="img/pulseband-cog-psych-section.jpg" alt="" class='image'>
				<p class='caption-text'>Users are presented with a graph of their current data. Since the graph is interactive, dragging a bar simulates the user’s potential future state of health.</p>
				<h5>Motivate: Small changes affect the big picture</h5>
				<p>Using the motivate design principle as a guide, I recognized that I needed to enable users to take ownership of their health while encouraging positive, sustainable change. Therefore, I used simulation as a way to connect a user’s current health state with a potential future state. This connection shoul be accessible, implementable, and actionable.</p> 
				<p class='subs-pg'>How to address the big picture of users’ overall heart health? From my literature review, I found that the <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/HeartAttackToolsResources/Heart-Attack-Risk-Assessment_UCM_303944_Article.jsp#.V0Yx6pMrJDU" target='_blank'>American Heart Association</a> gauges patients’ susceptibility to a cardiac event in the form of % risk. Because this boiled the varied and complex factors that affect heart health into a single output, I incorporated it so that users could come away from the experience with a distinct message.</p>
				<img src="img/pulseband-motivate-section.jpg" alt="" class='image'>
				<p class='caption-text'><img src="img/annotate-dot.png" alt="" class='annotate-dot'>The % Risk bar helps users understand how small changes in daily habits affect their overall susceptibility to a cardiac event.</p>
				<h5>Balance: Connect to medical professionals</h5>
				<p>Help users understand that this is a simulation of their health and that this can be a way for them to start a discussion about goals with their doctor. An important part of the Pulseband is that it has data on the age, height and weight of the user and can take measurements on factors related to heart health. Since this assignment gave us license to create fictitious features, this extends to cholesterol and blood sugar measures, though this technology isn’t on the market just yet.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>Therefore, the graph will come pre-populated with users’ data for each metric (blood pressure, heart rate, physical activity, cholesterol, blood sugars, and BMI). This way, users can simulate a future health state based off their current state.</p>

				<h4>Rapid Prototyping &amp; Usability Testing</h4>
				<p>Knowing that the prototyping process needed to incorporate interactivity to overcome the pain point of making data visualizations accessible and informative, I learned that some of the most informative prototypes could be low-fidelity. With a short timeline and development looming, paper prototyping was the most effective way to glean pain points and identify solutions.</p>
				<img src="img/pulseband-prototype1-annotated.jpg" alt="" class='image'>
				<p class='caption-text'><img src="img/annotate-dot.png" alt="" class='annotate-dot'>This prototype made it possible for me to identify pain points in interactivity. For example, users struggled with understanding the healthy range sections for each metric.</p>
				<p>In the prior prototype, users were confused about whether their health values fell within a healthy range, so I recognized that an interactive component of the graph needed to include the bars changing colors based on if the value was low, healthy, above average, and dangerous.</p>
				<img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class='image'>
				<p class='caption-text'>I used this prototype in illustrator to demonstrate interactivity that would occur when a bar was dragged from a healthy range to an unhealthy range. </p>

				<h3>Product Development</h3>
				<p>Being my own dev was difficult because with every exciting new idea, there was a major problem solving challenge. I was caught between the excitement of a more intuitive solution and the complexity of the coding test that this new idea presented. I had minimal programming experience going into the DESIGNATION program, so I worked tirelessly at learning the D3.js and jQuery libraries in order to implement my designs.</p>
				<h4>Final Product</h4>
				<img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class='image'>

					<div class="border-github-btn"><div class="github-btn"><a href="#">Github</a></div></div>
				</div>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>The experience of doing UX and development helped me understand how dev-UX relationships should operate: ownership and respect are key, collaboration is a key component of problem solving, and all roadblocks should be treated as opportunities for teammates to help one another. Now, I practice applying these principles in all projects I work on, including my future projects at DESIGNATION and beyond.</p>
