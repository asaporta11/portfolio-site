				<h3>Challenge</h3>
				<p><a href="#">Selfie</a> is an app that enables users to make and share their daily narratives, as well as seek out the stories of others around the globe. My partner and I evaluated the current version of the product and advised the client on product development and growth opportunities in a two week timeframe.  </p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>Selfie experienced high attrition rates: users engaged for a couple of days and rarely used it thereafter. The client wanted my partner and I to evaluate user needs and interactions of the current version and separately identify opportunities for growth and product development within a two week timeframe. They emphasized the primary focus of the app should enable users to create and develop story.
				</p>

				<h3>Evaluate</h3>
				<h4>Usability testing current version</h4>
				<p>To evaluate the current state of the product, my partner and I conducted usability testing and found that users felt uncomfortable watching the personal video content of unknown users; they didn’t have a vested interest in the lives of people they don’t know. Further, users felt awkward taking videos of themselves with only a front-facing camera option.</p>
				<div class= 'placeholder'><img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class="placeholder-img"></div>
				<p class='caption-text'>This is what the UI looked like when we started usability testing the current product.</p>
				<h4>Analysis of the Landscape</h4>
				<p>Usability testing indicated that we needed to gain a better understanding how Selfie fit into the current social media landscape, so we conducted a competitive analysis of the social media market. Our goal was to understand where the role of creating narratives fell amongst competitors.</p>
				<div class= 'placeholder'><img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class="placeholder-img"></div>
				
				<h4>Identifying User Needs</h4>
				<p>After learning that users were not likely to engage in storytelling regularly, and with ease, in public forums, we recognized that we needed to get a deeper understanding of prospective user behaviors, needs, motivations, and attitudes with user interviews. From our interpretation of the qualitative data and a literature review, we learned that story is most powerful and engaging if it is contextualized with a personality we know (such as a friend, acquaintance, or celebrity).</p>
				<div class= 'placeholder'><img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class="placeholder-img"></div>
				
				<h4>Synthesis</h4>
				<p>As we consolidated our data from user interviews, personas, and the competitive analysis, we found that key takeaways fell into three main categories:</p>
				<h6>Community</h6>
				<p>Users tend to actively engage in sharing video material most if content is shared amongst friends, family, and friends of friends. Video self-censorship and sharing increases in public forums: privacy is relevant, especially when it comes to video sharing.</p>
				<h6>Retention</h6>
				<p>Retention is guided by notifications and users feeling like they’re missing out on content relevant to their network.</p>
				<h6>Collaboration</h6>
				<p>Part of storytelling is letting a story evolve with the input of others. Using the creative writing exercise ‘exquisite corpse’ as an inspiration, we found that this would be a unique addition to the market. </p>

				<h3>Product Design</h3>
				<p>After evaluating Selfie’s role in the social media landscape, we learned that users seek not only to tell stories, but to build them as well; they indicated a need to create stories with friends as they unfolded in daily life. This blends users’ need to share snippets of their daily lives with building a story amongst close connections (close connections?... trying to find alt word for friend). </p>
				<h4>Design Principles</h4>
				<p>User personas showed us that social media is most engaging when it builds and sustains relationships. Callie taught us that she needed to stay connected after school and Nate wanted to be entertained while staying close to those he didn’t see often. Consequently, we created design principles to guide us through the process of ideating, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing. Throughout the product design process, we consistently asked ourselves if we were aligned with our principles. </p>
				<h6>Constraint</h6>
				<p>The best material comes with boundaries that drive user behavior toward easy sharing and collaboration.</p>
				<h6>Clarity</h6>
				<p>Create a singular identity that focuses on power of story.</p>
				<h6>Connection</h6>
				<p>Emphasis on sharing instantly to create a narrative with friends.</p>
				<h6>Psychology</h6>
				<p>Concentrate on the emotional experience of the user: make sure they feel safe sharing and are aware of where they are in the story.</p>
				<h4>App Map</h4>
				<p>I created an app map to help inform intuitive navigation during the wireframing process. Users sought more control over the video interface during usability testing, so one of the goals was planning the complexities and constraints of the video interface. Therefore, I included features such as uploading from the video library, a front- and back-facing camera, an editing studio, filters, and tips on cinematography and storytelling techniques. </p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>To address users’ privacy concerns, I created two sharing options: global or with friends. This enabled the app to function like a personal messaging app as well as providing users with a newsfeed of public content.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>To drive visibility of a new app like Selfie, I incorporated the option to share the completed story on other social media sites in addition to Selfie. </p>
				<img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class="placeholder-img">
				<h4>Wireframes and User Flows</h5>
				<p>Along with the intuitive navigation of the app map, the goal with wireframes and user flows was to help users understand where they were in the process of creating a story, sharing it with friends, and adding on to a narrative. I took inspiration from the phrase ‘form follows function’ to when designing the interactions.</p>
				<img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class="placeholder-img">
				<h4>Rapid Prototyping &amp; Usability Testing</h4>
				<p>Over the course of five days, I created three prototypes and put them through usability testing. I learned a great deal during each round of testing and made sure that each new prototype reflected that knowledge.</p>
				<img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class="placeholder-img">
				<p class='caption-text'>Gifs of each prototype.</p>	
				<h4>Roadmap</h4>
				<p>Iterating through each round of prototyping illuminated the values I wanted to emphasize in the roadmap. The goal of creating a roadmap was to guide the client when making decisions based on growth and preservation of the product. Each pinciple targets user engagement and product growth.</p>
				<img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class="placeholder-img">
				<h4>Key Learnings</h4>
				<p>The client decided to create this product and you can find it on the <a href="#">app store</a>.</p>
