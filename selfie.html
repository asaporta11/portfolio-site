				<h3>Challenge</h3>
				<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/selfie/id519885453?mt=8">Selfie</a> is an app that enables users to make and share their daily narratives, as well as seek out the stories of others around the globe. My partner and I evaluated the current version of the product, user needs, and advised the client on product development and growth opportunities in a 10 day timeframe.  </p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>As a starting point, the client told us that Selfie experienced high attrition rates after a couple of days and that their primary motivation in creating this app is<!-- The client wanted my partner and I to evaluate user needs and interactions of the current version and separately identify opportunities for growth and product development within a two week timeframe. --> <!-- The Selife team emphasized the primary focus of the app should  -->enabling users to create and develop story.

				<h3>Evaluate</h3>
				<h4>Usability testing current version</h4>
				<p>To evaluate the current state of the product, my partner and I conducted usability testing and discovered that users felt uncomfortable watching the personal video content of unknown users; <span>they didn’t have a vested interest in the lives of people they didn't know</span>. Further, users felt awkward taking videos of themselves with only a front-facing camera option.</p>
				<div class= 'multipic-container'><img src="img/selfie-4icon.PNG" alt="" class="multipic"><img src="img/selfie-3icon.PNG" alt="" class="multipic"></div>
				<p class='caption-text'>This is what the UI looked like when we started usability testing the current product.</p>
				<h4>Analysis of the Landscape</h4>
				<p>Usability testing indicated that we needed to gain a better understanding how Selfie fit into the current social media landscape, so we conducted a competitive analysis of the social media market. Our goal was to understand where the role of creating narratives fell amongst competitors.</p>
				<div class= 'placeholder'><img src="img/Selfie_CompetitiveAnalysis_6.7.16.jpg" alt="" class="vert-image"></div>
				<h5>Key Takeaways</h5>
				<p>The competitive analysis helped us deduce areas of the crowded social media market that had not yet been cornered. For example, we learned that increased privacy and reduced self-censorship correlated and we used this knowledge as we identified user needs.</p>

				<h4>Identifying User Needs</h4>
				<p>Once we learned that users were not likely to engage in storytelling regularly - or with ease - in public forums, we recognized that we needed to get a deeper understanding of prospective user behaviors, needs, motivations, and attitudes with user interviews. From our interpretation of the qualitative data and a literature review, we learned that story is most powerful and engaging if it is contextualized with a personality users know (i.e. a friend, acquaintance, or celebrity).</p>
				<div class= 'multipic-container'><img src="img/Selfie_Persona_Callie.jpg" alt="" class="multipic"><img src="img/Selfie_Persona_Jess.jpg" alt="" class="multipic"><img src="img/Selfie_Persona_Nate.jpg" alt="" class="multipic"></div>
				<p class='caption-text'>Among all groups, we found that story is most engaging when grounded in the preexisting knowledge of people or personas users know.</p>
				<h5>Key Takeaways</h5>
				<ul class='bullets'>
					<li>Callie taught us that older teens typically turn to video-based social media communication before text or picture-based forms and they use it primarily to collect moments with friends.</li>
					<li>Jess demonstrated that she often used video-based social media but found it more effortful compared to other forms. </li>
					<li>Nate emphasized that he was most comfortable with video-based social media as long as privacy features were within his control.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Synthesis</h4>
				<p>As we consolidated our data from user interviews, personas, and the competitive analysis, we found that key takeaways fell into three main categories:</p>
				<h6>Community</h6>
				<p>Users tend to actively engage in sharing video material most if content is shared amongst friends, family, and friends of friends - this was especially true for Nate. Video self-censorship and sharing increases in public forums.</p>
				<h6>Retention</h6>
				<p>Notifications and active user networks <!-- users sensing they're missing out on content relevant to their network  -->drive retention. This fits with Jess' motivation to stay connected with friends amidst school, homework, other social media sites, and activities competing with her time.</p>
				<h6>Collaboration</h6>
				<p>Part of storytelling is letting a story evolve with the input of others. Callie demonstrated an organically generated 'collection' of moments she collected with friends. Therefore, <span>we found that stringing timepoints together would address unmet user needs and be a unique addition to the market</span>.</p>

				<h3>Product Design</h3>
				<p>After evaluating Selfie’s role in the social media landscape, we learned that users seek not only to tell stories, but to build them; <span>they indicated a need to create stories with friends as they unfolded in daily life.</span> This connects users’ need to share snippets of their daily lives to building a story among close connections. </p>

				<h4>Design Principles</h4>
				<p>User personas showed us that social media is most engaging when it builds and sustains relationships. Consequently, we created design principles to guide us through the process of ideating, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing. Throughout the product design process, we consistently asked ourselves if we were aligned with our principles. </p>
				<h6>Constraint</h6>
				<p>Sharing and collaboration generates material with ease when boundaries keep material succinct and attractive.</p>
				<h6>Clarity</h6>
				<p>Create a singular product identity that focuses on the power of story.</p>
				<h6>Connection</h6>
				<p>Emphasize instantly creating a narrative with friends.</p>
				<h6>Psychology</h6>
				<p>Concentrate on the emotional experience of the user: make sure they feel safe sharing and are aware of where they are in the story.</p>
				<h5>Key Takeaways</h5>
				<p>Defining these principles enabled us to prioritize which key features of a collaborative video sharing experience were most important to address first.</p>

				<h4>App Map</h4>
				<p>I created an app map to help inform intuitive navigation during the wireframing process.</p>
				<img src="img/SelfieAppMap.jpg" alt="" class="placeholder-img">
				<p class='subs-pg'>Users sought more control over the video interface during usability testing, so one of the goals was planning the complexities and constraints of the video interface. Therefore, I included the following features:</p>
				<ul class='bullets'>
					<li>uploading from the user's video library</li>
					<li>a front- and back-facing camera</li>
					<li>an editing studio</li>
					<li>filters</li>
					<li>tips on cinematography and storytelling techniques</li>
				</ul>
				<p class='subs-pg'><span>To address users’ privacy concerns, I created two sharing options: global or with friends.</span> This enabled the app to function like a personal messaging app as well as provide users with a public newsfeed.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>To drive visibility of a new app like Selfie, I incorporated the <span>option to share the completed story on other social media sites</span> in addition to Selfie. </p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>We used the ‘exquisite corpse’ exercise as an inspiration to add delight and engagement to the user experience: <span>when adding onto a story, users are only able to view the latest clip added to the story.</span> Therefore, they cannot watch the full story until they have added on themselves. This allows for a story to evolve naturally, decreases pressure on users who feel the need to add something 'brilliant,' and further adds a sense of uniqueness to the user experience.</p>
				
				<h4>Rapid Prototyping &amp; Usability Testing</h4>
				<p>Over the course of five days, I created three prototypes and put them through usability testing. I learned a great deal during each round of testing and made sure that each new prototype reflected that knowledge.</p>
				<h6>Paper Prototyping</h6>
				<img src="img/selfie_pop_trial6.gif" alt="" class="gif-style">
				<p class='subs-pg'>Paper prototyping helped me iron out some early creases. For example, I learned that the stories page was too visually busy and that users got confused when contributing to a story. I also found that users appreciated the way I incorporated common film making terms to the process, so I included more references in subsequent prototypes.</p>	
				<h6>Prototype 2</h6>
				<img src="img/selfie_invision2_try6.gif" alt="" class="gif-style">
				<p class='subs-pg'>Round 2 helped me identify pain points in adding onto a story and acquainting users to the general concept of the app.</p>
				<h6>Prototype 3</h6>
				<img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class="placeholder-img"><p>Round 3 unearthed nuanced pain points such as which attributes of pages users' attention was drawn to, especially at endpoint pages.</p>

				<h4>Wireframes and User Flows</h5>
				<p>Along with the intuitive navigation of the app map, the goal with wireframes and user flows was to help users understand where they were in the process of creating a story, sharing it with friends, and adding onto a narrative. I took inspiration from the phrase ‘form follows function’ when designing these interactions.</p>
				<h6>Overall Flow</h6>
				<img src="img/SelfieWireFlow_6_15_16_NoAnnotations_bknd_better.jpg" alt="" class="horiz-image">
				<p class='subs-pg'>This is a comprehensive view of how specific user behaviors - creating a story, contributing to a story, and responding to a notification - connect to each other.</p>
				<h6>Respond to a notification</h6>
				<img src="img/SelfieContFrmNotification@1x-annotated.jpg" alt="" class="horiz-image">
				<p class='subs-pg'><img src="img/annotate-dot.png" alt="" class='annotate-dot'>This flow exemplifies how users respond to a notification and go on to contribute to a story. Inspired by the phrase 'form follows function,' I structured each story such that it looks like a series of clips assembled in a sequence.</p>				
				<h6>Create a story</h6>
				<img src="img/SelfieCreateStoryShareFriends@1x-annotated.jpg" alt="" class="horiz-image">
				<p class='subs-pg'><img src="img/annotate-dot.png" alt="" class='annotate-dot'>This is the process users undergo when they create a story and share it with friends. To enable user trust and control, users have the option to share with friends or global after they've created a story.</p>



				<h4>Roadmap</h4>
				<p>Iterating through each round of prototyping illuminated the values I wanted to emphasize in the roadmap. The goal of creating a roadmap was to guide the client when making decisions based on growth and preservation of the product. Each pinciple targets user engagement and product growth.</p>
				<img src="img/SelfieRoadmap.jpg" alt="" class="vert-image">
				<p class='subs-pg'>The goal is to connect to users with a clear, compelling product purpose driven by a solid onboarding process. The next step is to embed the app in users' lives with opportunities to make global group stories based on location or demographics with the goal to drive engagement. With a solid user base, the next step is to add video functionalities that differeniate Selfie from their competitors. To help Selfie resonate with users, enable sharing with other social media apps using a Selfie watermark.</p>

				<h4>Result &amp; Key Learnings</h4>
				<p>This project threw me into UX work without the pressures of looming development for the first time thereby enabling me to dive deeper in to UX work, which gave me the opportunity to work with new tools and iterate more rapidly than before. I used Sketch, Invision App, and POP - Paper Prototyping for the first time. <!-- Further, this was my first chance to work with a real client that had high expectations and articulate feedback. --></p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>The client created an app based off my idea and you can find it on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/groupsnap/id1030789359?mt=8" target="_blank">app store</a>! It's invigorating to know that my designs are in the marketplace and that users interact with them every day.</p> 
				<p class='subs-pg'>The app released on the app store differs from my design in a few key ways. First, the app is called GroupSnap and not Selfie. Second, my interaction design varies from theirs. For example, my buttons were inspired by the saying 'form follows function' so a timeline looks like one, whereas theirs is a collection of thumbnails spread across an entire screen.</p>
				<img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class="placeholder-img">
				<p class='caption-text'>Me using GroupSnap with my friends!</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>This project enabled me to refine my 'UX eye,' learn how to move through a project speedily while mastering new tools, and adjust to a new client environment. Working with a client who cares deeply for their work was exciting because it gave me access to extremely specific feedback. Finally, seeing my designs on the app store and using an app that I co-created with my friends was thrilling. Each new experience forced me to adapt and appreciate UX design in a whole new way - I take these insights with me as I approach new <a href="index.html#projects">projects</a>.</p>
