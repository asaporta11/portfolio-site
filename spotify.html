				<h3>Challenge</h3>
				<p>I worked with another front-end developer to make a web app that facilitated the process of getting to know more about usersâ€™ favorite music artists. My partner was responsible for the UI design and CSS while I pulled data from the Spotify, Echonest, and YouTube APIs.</p>  
				<p class='subs-pg'>My partner and I were given the freedom to make decisions about the functionality of the product as long as it pulled data from the Spotify API. We used daily stand ups and scrum methodology to ensure that we built the project on schedule and communicated effectively throughout.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="define" class="define proj-text">
				<h3>Define</h3>
				<p>Before diving into development my partner, Abe, and I defined our requirements. We were commited to an iterative, collaborative design process so we started off by articulating our responsibilities: Abe focused on UI design and CSS, while I concentrated on pulling data from APIs - a task that I had no prior experience with.
				<p class='subs-pg'>After ideating possible areas of focus, <span>we decided to make an app that helps users learn about their favorite music artists from a singular digital platform.<!-- When defining the focal point of the app, we continued to return to the fact that we wished we could find out more about our favorite artists from a singular digital platform, so we decided this would be the core functionality. --></span> We chose this focus because we realized that knowing the backstories and details of artists' lives makes their music more meaningful; it gives the music a broader context. Therefore, our goal was to give users access to biographical information, video interviews, and exposure to artists' work - all in one place. </p> 
			</section>
			<section id='build' class='build proj-text'>
				<h3>Build</h3>
				<p>Since this was a development-focused sprint and we had 10 days to complete the project, we did not have enough time to engage in a rapid prototyping process, so we relied on communication and scrum methodology to make sure we were on the same page throughout.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>I quickly realized that I needed to use more than just the assigned Spotify API, so I explored various APIs from which to pull biographical information and artist interviews. Using the Echonest, YouTube, and Spotify APIs, Abe and I agreed that I would pull artist biographies (Echonest), their top three most popular interviews (YouTube), 30s clips of their top 10 songs (Spotify), and their name and picture (Spotify).</p>
				<!-- <div class= 'placeholder'> --><img src="img/spotify-responsibilities.jpg" alt="" class="spot-build-image"><!-- </div> -->
				<p class='caption-text'>Abe and I agreed upon our responsibilities. My goal was to tackle the basic features section and leave enough of a time buffer to handle the nice to haves.</p>

				<h3>Learning Curve</h3>
				<p>With no prior knowledge of AJAX, JSON, or RESTful practices, I used the CodeSchool and Treehouse platforms (plus a lot of googling) to teach myself these skills as I implemented them in our project. It took a long time for me to make my first AJAX call correctly but, once I did, everything got a little bit easier. By seemingly console logging everything I could, I familiarized myself with the complexitites of multi-threaded JavaScript and pulling data.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>Abe and I regularly communicated about where we were making progress and struggling - we talked through our respective challenges and helped each other wherever we could.</p> 
				<h4>Final Product</h4>
				<div class= 'placeholder'><img src="img/placeholder-img.png" alt="" class="placeholder-img"></div>
				<p class='caption-text'>Placeholder text</p>

				<div class='btn-container'>
					<a href="#" class='btn'>Final Product</a>
					<a href="#" class='btn'>Github</a>
				</div>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>The process of learning new methodologies and skills on the fly was uncomfortable yet thrilling because I often felt pressure to get data to Abe but didn't initially know how to. Scrum methodology helped me stay aware of what Abe needed from me, though glancing at our scrum board often made me keenly aware of the unsolved problems that lay ahead. That said, it enabled me to tackle the 'nice to haves' Abe and I initially outlined so users can listen to 30s clips of artist's top 10 songs, thereby making the exploration experience more comprehensive. Learning about multithreaded JavaScript and JSON structures served me especially well on <a href="creative.html">projects</a> after DESIGNATION.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>Building a tool without undergoing a rapid prototyping process and user testing felt wrong. I had so many questions about the usability and design of the product yet was unable to test them. That didn't stop Abe and I from discussing them yet the process felt incomplete; in subsequent projects, I remind myself of the uneasy feeling of buiding something without research and testing, and it serves as one of the many experiences that motivate me to be the best designer I can be.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>I enjoyed working with a partner because we were always honest about what we had difficulties with, which helped us support each other. I'm grateful that Abe was an exemplary partner because he understood when I needed more time and, likewise, helped me celebrate little bits of progress. This was a great opportunity to learn about helping teammates while working in a high intensity sprint environment; I approach subsequent projects feeling a responsibility to help my partners overcome their challenges. </p>
