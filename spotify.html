				<h3>Challenge</h3>
				<p>I worked with another front-end developer to develop a web app that facilitated the process of getting to know more about users’ favorite music artists. My partner was responsible for the UI design and CSS while I pulled data from the Spotify, Echonest, and youtube APIs.</p>  <p class='subs-pg'>My partner and I were given the freedom to make decisions about the functionality of the product as long as it pulled data from the Spotify API. We used daily stand ups and scrum methodology to ensure that we finished building the project on time and collaborated throughout.</p>

			<section id="define" class="define">
				<h3>Define</h3>
				<p>Before diving into development, my partner, Abe, and I defined our requirements. We were commited to an iterative, collaborative design process so we were clear about our responsibilities: Abe focused on UI design and CSS, while I focused solely on pulling data from APIs. When defining the focal point of the app, we continued to return to the fact that we wished we could find out more about our favorite artists from a singular digital platform, so we decided this would be the core functionality. </p>

				<h3>Build</h3>
				<p>Since this was a development-focused sprint and we only had two weeks to complete the project, we did not have enough time to engage in a rapid prototyping process, so we relied on communication and scrum methodology to make sure we were on the same page throughout the process.</p>
				<p class='subs-pg'>I quickly realized that I needed to use more than just the assigned Spotify API, so I explored various APIs from which to pull biographical information and artist interviews. Using the Echonest, youtube, and Spotify APIs, Abe and I agreed that I would pull artist biographies (Echonest), their top three most popular interviews (youtube), thirty second clips of their top ten songs (spotify), and their name and picture (spotify).</p>

				<h3>Learning Curve</h3>
				<p>With no prior knowledge of asynchronous calls or JSON, I used the CodeSchool and Treehouse platforms (plus a lot of googling) to teach myself these skills as I implemented them in our project. Abe and I regularly communicated about where we were making progress and struggling - Abe and I would talk through our respective challenges and help each other out wherever we could.</p>

				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>I enjoyed the process of working with a partner: we were always honest about what we were experiencing difficulty with, which helped us support each other. It was uncomfortable yet thrilling to learn on the fly while implementing the project because I often felt pressure to get data to my partner but wasn’t sure how to at first. This was a great opportunity to learn about helping teammates while working in a high intensity sprint environment.</p>
